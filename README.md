# Most Popular
Generate the markup for our year-end most-pop lists. Also, Google Analytics doesn't publish headlines with its PVs, so we need to be able to add that data to the spreadsheet.

# Dev notes
When figuring out Oauth2 access, always always use http://gspread.readthedocs.org/en/latest/oauth2.html

Be sure to share the spreadsheet with the email address stored in the ACCOUNT_USER env var.

# Workflow

1. In GA, export the most-pop articles (I usually do the top 1,000) as a CSV.
1. Rename the previous year's Google sheets document "popular-PREVIOUSYEAR"
1. Duplicate the previous year's Google sheets document, name it "popular"
1. Empty out the contents of the sheets document's tabs.
1. Paste the exported GA CSV into the "all" tab. Paste the CSV starting at the second column -- the first column should be left blank for the headline, which we import programmatically.
1. The section field is generated by hand (haha / sob)
2. *Add the headlines*. Use writesheet.py to get the headlines into the spreadsheet (if you put all articles in the tab named "all," `python writesheet.py all` will do that. Unicode errors will output to the command line, just add those into the spreadsheet by hand. When the script stops and is restarted, it picks up where it left off (it starts at the first empty title row).
3. Currently we don't have a way to get the article section, so that work needs to be done by hand.
4. Create section-specific spreadsheets, one sheet per section. Add the section's items from the "all" spreadsheet to that section-specific sheet.
5. To turn the section-specific spreadsheet into markup, run `$ python writesheet.py news --publish | head -n 100` (change the "news" to whichever section you're running this on). The `| head -n 100` means "Show only the first 100 lines." That will output something like
